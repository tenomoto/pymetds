NEAT enables us to count the genesis and tracks of individual cyclones as well as the number of merged and separated cyclones. Little difference in cyclone genesis or track climatology in the Northern Hemisphere was found between NEAT and conventional tracking. The NEAT results indicate a high probability of cyclone merger in the western Pacific and western Atlantic. Composite maps and backtracking from merged cyclones reveal the characteristics of merged cyclones. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},
